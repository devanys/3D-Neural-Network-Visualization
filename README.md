## Overview
**3D Neural Network Visualization** is an interactive web-based application designed to visually represent the internal structure and behavior of a neural network in three-dimensional space. This project aims to help students, researchers, and practitioners better understand how neural networks process data, learn features, and produce predictions.

## Key Features
- 🔹 **3D CNN Architecture Visualization**  
  Visualizes convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers in a 3D environment.

- 🔹 **Real-Time Training Simulation**  
  Displays training progress including loss, accuracy, validation metrics, and epoch updates.

- 🔹 **Interactive Controls**  
  Adjust learning rate, batch size, training split, orbit speed, and checkpoint intervals.

- 🔹 **Loss Landscape Visualization**  
  Shows how loss values evolve across training iterations.

- 🔹 **Digit Input & Prediction**  
  Draw input digits and observe how the network processes and predicts them.

- 🔹 **Layer-wise Activation View**  
  See how feature maps and neurons activate across different layers.
